## Revisions

note-taker_v1.0 - Initial commit: Note taker save feature is currently capable of writing note data to db.json file. Need to figure out how to update the data displayed being rendered by the server.

note-taker_v1.1 - Notes are now being rendered after creation of a new note. Notes can also be deleted, however it seems there is an issue with the delete request functionality as it will not work after a new note has been saved.

note-taker_v1.2 - Added a readFile function to the delete feature, as it turns out it wasn't receiving updated data from the db.json file. The delete feature is now functional.

note-taker_v1.3 - Commented code and updated README file.
